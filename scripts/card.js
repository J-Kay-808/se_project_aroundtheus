//Create the Card class. This creates a card with text and an image link, along with the appropriate handlers.

// It should accept the following arguments:

// data: an object containing the card's text and a link to its image
// cardSelector: a selector string for the corresponding <template> element
// handleImageClick: a function that handles the opening of the preview picture modal. You should already have this function from previous iterations of the project, although it might have a different name, or it might be an anonymous function. See below for notes on how to implement it.
// It should also have private methods for working with markup and adding event listeners, including:

// a _setEventListeners method that sets the necessary event listeners

// export default class Card {
//   constructor({ name, link }, cardSelector, handleImageClick) {
//     this._name = name;
//     this._link = link;
//     this._cardSelector = cardSelector;
//     this._handleImageClick = handleImageClick;
//   }

//   getView() {}
// }
